MHacksV Bus Collaborative Drawing

This small python webapp was thrown together on the bus ride back from MHacks to provide bored people with a way to draw silly things together. Yay for buses with WiFi!

Outstanding issues:
	- Mobile works, but drawing can sometimes scroll the page.
	- Can only draw with one color, and there's no eraser. There's only a "clear" button.
